# Monitoring and Alerts

## Overview

This document outlines how we use **AWS CloudWatch** for application **logging** and **basic alerting** to ensure that our applications are functioning correctly. As developers, our primary goal is to monitor logs for errors and performance issues, set up alerts for critical problems, and respond quickly to ensure the application remains available and responsive.

## AWS CloudWatch for Logging and Monitoring

AWS CloudWatch is the primary tool we use to monitor our applications. It allows us to collect and analyze logs, track performance metrics, and set up simple alerts to notify the team of critical issues. Our approach focuses on keeping things simple: we monitor the application’s logs and set up basic alert thresholds to ensure that the app is running smoothly.

1. **CloudWatch Logs**

**CloudWatch Logs** collects and stores logs generated by our application. These logs provide valuable insights into how the application is running, helping us detect and resolve issues quickly.

- **What we log**:

  - **Errors**: Capture any exceptions, stack traces, or warnings that may indicate bugs or issues.
  - **Key Events**: Log important events such as service start-ups, shutdowns, and critical application workflows.
  - **Custom Log Messages**: Developers can insert custom log messages into the application to track specific events or troubleshoot issues.

- **How we use logs**:
  - **Error Detection**: Search logs for error patterns or exceptions that may indicate problems with the application.
  - **Performance Issues**: Identify slow-performing parts of the application by analyzing log timestamps.
  - **User Activity Tracking**: Optionally, track important user activities (e.g., logins, API calls) to monitor how the application is being used.

2. **Log Retention and Management**

By default, CloudWatch Logs retain logs indefinitely, but we can configure log retention based on our needs.

- **Log Retention**: We configure retention policies to automatically delete older logs after a certain period (e.g., 30 days) to avoid unnecessary storage costs.
- **Log Groups**: Logs are organized into Log Groups that represent different environments (e.g., development, test, production). Each environment’s logs are kept separate to make it easier to track issues specific to that environment.

## Basic Alerting with CloudWatch

We set up basic alerts in AWS CloudWatch to notify the team when certain critical thresholds are crossed. Alerts help us respond quickly to issues that could affect application performance or availability.

1. **CloudWatch Alarms**

CloudWatch Alarms are used to automatically trigger notifications based on predefined conditions. These alarms monitor key metrics and log patterns to detect potential issues with the application.

- **What we monitor**:
  - **Error Patterns**: Trigger an alarm when specific error messages or patterns appear in the logs (e.g., repeated exceptions, failed API calls).
  - **Log Volume**: Monitor for unexpected spikes or drops in log volume, which could indicate application instability (e.g., a crash or unusually high usage).
  - **Custom Metrics**: If needed, we can create custom metrics based on log data to track things like API request errors or failed login attempts.

2. **Setting Thresholds for Alarms**

We configure thresholds for alerts based on the severity of potential issues. Here are a few examples:

- **Error Alerts**: Trigger an alarm if a specific error or exception appears more than a set number of times within a defined period (e.g., 5 errors in 5 minutes).
- **Performance Alerts**: Trigger an alarm if the response time exceeds a specific threshold, based on log data.
- **Custom Log Alerts**: For critical sections of the application, custom log messages can trigger alerts when certain conditions are met (e.g., "Order failed" logs exceed a certain threshold).

3. **Alerting Channels**

We use basic alerting channels to notify the team when alarms are triggered:

- **Email Notifications**: Alerts are sent via email when critical errors or performance issues are detected.
- **Team Chat**: Optional integration with tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams can provide real-time notifications of application issues.

## Best Practices for Logging and Alerts

1. **Log Meaningful Information**

- Focus on logging meaningful information that will help diagnose issues. Avoid excessive logging of trivial data, as it can make it harder to find useful information.
- Log critical errors, key events, and exceptions that could indicate a problem with the application.

2. **Set Clear Alert Thresholds**

- Configure clear and actionable alert thresholds to avoid false positives. For example, setting a high threshold for minor warnings may prevent unnecessary alerts.
- Ensure that alerts are configured for key issues, such as frequent errors or crashes.

3. **Review and Tune Alerts**

- Regularly review alerts and adjust thresholds based on the current performance and usage patterns of the application.
- Fine-tune alerts to ensure they capture real issues without overwhelming the team with unnecessary notifications.

4. **Manage Log Retention**

- Set log retention policies to balance between retaining enough data for troubleshooting and avoiding excessive storage costs. Typically, logs for production environments may be kept longer than logs for development or test environments.
