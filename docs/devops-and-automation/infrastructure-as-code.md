# Infrastructure as Code

## Overview

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. By using IaC, we can automate the creation, management, and scaling of infrastructure resources in a consistent and reliable manner.

This document outlines how we use **AWS CDK** and **AWS CloudFormation** to define and deploy infrastructure across our **development**, **test**, and **production** environments. Our IaC practices ensure that infrastructure is version-controlled, consistent, and scalable across all environments.

## Key Principles of IaC

1. **Consistency**

- Using IaC ensures that infrastructure across development, test, and production environments is consistent. We define the same infrastructure components (e.g., compute, networking, databases) across all environments, reducing human error.

2. **Version Control**

- All infrastructure code is stored in GitHub alongside our application code. This ensures that infrastructure changes can be tracked, reviewed, and rolled back if necessary, just like any other code change.

3. **Automation**

- Infrastructure provisioning and updates are fully automated through the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and IaC tools like AWS CDK and AWS CloudFormation. This reduces the need for manual intervention and speeds up deployment cycles.

4. **Scalability**

- IaC enables the ability to scale infrastructure easily. By modifying the infrastructure code, we can automatically adjust resources (e.g., increase or decrease the number of servers, storage capacity, etc.) based on the application's needs.

## Tools and Technologies

1. **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)**

We use AWS CDK as our primary tool for defining and managing infrastructure in AWS. CDK allows us to define infrastructure using familiar programming languages (e.g., C#), which then generates AWS CloudFormation templates to provision resources.

- **Advantages of AWS CDK**:
  - **Declarative Infrastructure**: You define infrastructure resources using code, and CDK automatically generates the CloudFormation templates to deploy those resources.
  - **Reusable Components**: CDK allows us to define reusable infrastructure components, making it easy to scale infrastructure across different environments.
  - **Multi-Environment Support**: Easily manage infrastructure for development, test, and production environments by passing environment-specific configurations.

2. **AWS CloudFormation**

While AWS CDK is used to write infrastructure code, AWS CloudFormation is the underlying service that provisions and manages AWS resources. CDK generates CloudFormation templates, which are then used to deploy infrastructure resources in AWS.

- **CloudFormation Capabilities**:
  - **Stack Management**: CloudFormation organizes infrastructure as stacks, allowing us to easily manage, update, or delete resources in a single operation.
  - **Rollback Capabilities**: If a deployment fails, CloudFormation automatically rolls back the infrastructure to its previous state, ensuring stability.

## IaC Workflow

1. **Infrastructure Code in GitHub**

- All infrastructure code (written in AWS CDK) is stored in GitHub, alongside our application code. This ensures that any changes to infrastructure go through the same version control and code review process as the application code.
- Developers can submit pull requests (PRs) with infrastructure changes, which are reviewed before being merged into the `main` branch.

2. **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**

- When infrastructure changes are merged into the `main` branch, the CI/CD pipeline (using **GitHub Actions**) is triggered to deploy the infrastructure changes automatically.
  - **Development Environment**: Infrastructure changes are first deployed to the **development environment** for internal testing.
  - **Test Environment**: Once validated, infrastructure changes are promoted to the **test environment** during the release candidate process.
  - **Production Environment**: After UAT, infrastructure changes are deployed to the **production environment**.

3. **Deployment Process**

For every environment (development, test, production), the following steps are followed:

1. **Define Infrastructure in AWS CDK**:

   - Developers write code using AWS CDK to define infrastructure resources (e.g., API Gateways, Lambda Functions).
   - The CDK code defines how resources should be provisioned, configured, and scaled.

2. **Generate CloudFormation Templates**:

   - AWS CDK automatically generates CloudFormation templates from the CDK code.
   - These templates contain the declarative definition of the infrastructure resources.

3. **Deploy Resources Using CloudFormation**:

   - The CloudFormation templates are deployed via GitHub Actions.
   - CloudFormation provisions the AWS resources in the specified environment (development, test, or production).
   - **Rollback Mechanism**: If a resource fails to deploy, CloudFormation automatically rolls back to the previous stable state.

4. **Test and Validate**:
   - After the infrastructure is deployed, smoke tests and validation steps are performed to ensure the resources are functioning as expected.

## Environment-Specific Configurations

Each environment (development, test, production) may have different infrastructure requirements. Using AWS CDK, we can parameterize our infrastructure code to ensure that the correct resources are provisioned in each environment.

- **Development Environment**:

  - Lower-cost resources (e.g., smaller EC2 instances or RDS databases) may be provisioned to reduce costs during development.
  - Frequent deployments and updates as part of the development process.

- **Test Environment**:

  - Resources are configured to closely mirror production, ensuring that tests are conducted in an environment similar to production.
  - Automatic rollbacks are enabled in case of failed deployments.

- **Production Environment**:
  - Full-scale infrastructure is provisioned to handle production traffic and workloads.
  - Higher levels of redundancy and fault tolerance are built into the infrastructure.
  - Monitoring and alerts are configured for critical production services.

## Best Practices for IaC

1. **Use Version Control for Infrastructure**

- All infrastructure code must be stored in GitHub alongside application code.
- Changes to infrastructure must go through the same PR review process as application code to ensure consistency and avoid misconfigurations.

2. **Modularize Infrastructure**

- Use modular components in AWS CDK to reuse infrastructure definitions across different environments and applications.
- Modularizing infrastructure code makes it easier to manage and scale infrastructure resources.

3. **Test Infrastructure Changes**

- Before applying infrastructure changes to the **test** or **production** environments, test them thoroughly in the **development** environment.
- Run smoke tests and automated tests to ensure the infrastructure is functioning as expected.

4. **Automate Rollbacks**

- Enable automatic rollbacks in CloudFormation to revert infrastructure changes if something fails during deployment.
- Use monitoring tools to detect failures early and trigger rollbacks when necessary.

5. **Securely Manage Secrets**

- Use AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Azure Key Vault to securely store and retrieve sensitive data like API keys, credentials, and database passwords during infrastructure provisioning.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in the infrastructure code.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After infrastructure has been provisioned, it is important to monitor and maintain the resources to ensure they operate efficiently.

1. **Monitoring**

- Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the health, performance, and utilization of AWS resources.
- Set up alarms to notify the team if there are any issues (e.g., high CPU usage, memory leaks, low disk space).

2. **Cost Management**

- Regularly review the cost of infrastructure resources.
- Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor AWS usage and identify potential cost-saving opportunities (e.g., scaling down unused resources in non-production environments).

3. **Infrastructure Updates**

- Ensure that infrastructure resources are regularly updated to take advantage of new features and security improvements.
- AWS CDK and CloudFormation make it easy to update resources through code.
