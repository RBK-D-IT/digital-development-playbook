# CI/CD Pipeline and Automation

## Overview

Our **CI/CD pipeline** automates the integration, testing, and deployment of code changes. Using **GitHub**, **GitHub Actions**, **AWS CDK**, and **AWS CloudFormation**, we ensure that code is continuously integrated, tested, and deployed across multiple environments (development, test, and production) efficiently and consistently.

The main stages in our CI/CD pipeline include:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated testing and validation of code when changes are pushed.
2. **Automated Deployments**: Deployments triggered by merges into `develop` or `main`.
3. **On-Demand Deployments**: Manual deployments to all environments when needed.

## Key Stages of the CI/CD Pipeline

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

When a feature or bug fix is pushed to a branch in GitHub, the CI pipeline is triggered via GitHub Actions.

**Steps in the CI Stage**:

- **Build**: The application is compiled, packaged, or containerised as needed.
- **Automated Testing**:
  - **Unit Tests**: Validate individual components or functions.
  - **Integration Tests**: Ensure that services interact correctly.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate user workflows.
- **Code Linting**: Check for code quality and adherence to standards.

If any step fails, the pipeline notifies the developer to make changes and re-run the pipeline.

### 2. Automated Deployments

#### **Test Environment**

- **Trigger**:
  - A PR is merged into `develop`.
  - A developer triggers a manual deployment.
- **Action**:
  - The pipeline automatically deploys to the **test environment**.
  - AWS CDK assumes an AWS role to deploy in the test account.
  - Integration and smoke tests run to validate stability.

#### **Production Environment**

- **Trigger**:
  - A PR is merged into `main`.
  - A developer triggers a manual deployment.
- **Action**:
  - The pipeline automatically deploys to the **production environment**.
  - AWS CDK provisions or updates production infrastructure.
  - Post-deployment monitoring ensures stability.

---

### 3. On-Demand Deployments

- Developers can trigger manual deployments to **Development**, **Test** and **Production** environments.
- This is useful for debugging, feature previews, or infrastructure testing.
- Manual deployments (like automated deployments) are configured via GitHub Actions.

## Best Practices for CI/CD Pipeline

### 1. Automate All Stages

- **Automated Testing**: Ensure all commits are validated with unit, integration, and E2E tests.
- **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**: Automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use AWS CDK for consistent infrastructure management.

### 2. Secure Secrets Management

- **GitHub Secrets**: Store API keys, AWS credentials, and environment variables securely.
- **AWS IAM Roles**: Limit AWS permissions to only what is necessary for deployments.

### 3. Environment-Specific Pipelines

- **Development**: Frequent, on-demand deployments for internal testing.
- **Test**: Ensures stable releases via UAT before merging to `main`.
- **Production**: Controlled, automated deployments with monitoring.

### 4. Rollback Mechanism

- Use AWS CloudFormation rollback strategies in case of deployment failures.
- Ensure previous stable versions can be redeployed quickly if needed.

### 5. Monitor and Optimise Pipeline Performance

- **Parallel Testing**: Speed up CI by running tests in parallel.
- **Monitoring**: Use AWS CloudWatch and GitHub Actions logs to track pipeline execution.

## Tools and Technologies

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates builds, tests, and deployments.
- **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**: Manages infrastructure as code.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Deploys infrastructure across AWS environments.
- **GitHub Secrets**: Stores sensitive credentials securely.
- **Monitoring Tools**: AWS CloudWatch tracks application performance post-deployment.
