# Introduction

Welcome to the Royal Borough of Kingston's **Digital Development Playbook** repository. This playbook serves as a comprehensive guide for our team, outlining best practices, standards, and processes for developing and deploying applications, APIs, and other digital products. The playbook is designed to ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency in our development workflows while also providing key documentation as we adopt cloud technologies like AWS and modern DevOps practices.

## Purpose

The Digital Playbook provides guidance on:

- **General Development Practices**: Coding standards, branching strategies, testing practices, and code review.
- **DevOps and Automation**: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure management, and automated deployments.

This playbook is intended to evolve over time as we refine our processes and adopt new technologies. Contributions from the team are encouraged to keep this playbook up to date and relevant.
