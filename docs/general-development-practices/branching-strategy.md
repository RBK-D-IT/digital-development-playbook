# Branching Strategy and Git Workflow

## Overview

Our development process follows a **Git Flow** methodology to ensure smooth collaboration and deployment across environments. This strategy encourages frequent collaboration and continuous integration, with **feature / bugfix branches** for development, a **develop branch** for preparing production releases, and a **main branch** for production deployments managed through GitHub and CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Concepts

1. **Main Branch (`main`)**:

   - Represents **stable, production-ready code**.
   - Code merged into `main` is automatically deployed to the **production environment**.

2. **Develop Branch (`develop`)**:

   - The **integration branch** for ongoing development.
   - All feature / bugfix branches must be merged into `develop` before going to `main`.
   - Code merged into `develop` is automatically deployed to the **test environment**.

3. **Feature and Bugfix Branches (`feature/*`, `bugfix/*`)**:

   - Each new feature or bug fix is developed in a separate branch created off of `develop`.
   - Feature branches should be named descriptively, including an issue ticket reference if applicable. For more details on how branches should be named, see the [Naming Conventions](naming-conventions.md#2-git-branch-and-commit-naming-conventions) page.
   - All changes are tested locally or in the **develop environment** before being merged into `develop` through a Pull Request (PR) process.

4. **Pull Requests (PRs)**:

   - Once a feature or fix is complete, create a pull request (PR) to merge the changes into the `develop` branch.
   - PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before merging.
   - Automated tests (via CI pipelines) will run against each PR to ensure stability.

5. **Merging to `main`**:

   - After UAT / tests are complete, `develop` is merged into `main` via a PR.
   - Merging to `main` triggers an automatic deployment to the **production environment**.

6. **Syncing Branches**:

   - Always merge `main` back into `develop` to ensure features / bug fixes are being created from the latest **stable, production-ready code**.

## Workflow Example

1. **Create a Branch**:

   - From the `develop` branch, create a feature branch:
     ```bash
     git switch develop
     git pull origin develop
     git switch -C feature/your-feature-name
     # or for bug fixes: git switch -C bugfix/your-bugfix-name
     ```

2. **Work on Your Feature**:

   - Make meaningful commits to the feature branch, following the [Conventional Commits](../general-development-practices/coding-standards.md#commit-message-standards-conventional-commits) specification for commit messages.
   - Commit messages should include a type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`) and a short description of the change.
   - If working on a collaborative project, always keep your branch up to date with `develop` through rebasing:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     git rebase origin/develop
     ```

3. **Push Your Branch to GitHub**:

   - Push your branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

4. **Open a Pull Request**:

   - Once the feature is complete, open a pull request to merge your feature branch into `develop`.

5. **Merging into `develop`**:

   - After your pull request has been reviewed and approved, and all CI tests pass, merge the feature branch into `develop` using a **squash and merge commit**.
   - This will trigger an automatic deployment to the **test environment**.

6. **Merging `develop` into `main`**:

   - Once the code in `develop` is stable and ready for production, create a PR from `develop` to `main`.
   - Review and approve the PR, and merge using a **merge commit**.

7. **Update `develop`**:
   - Update `develop` to bring the latest changes in `main`:
     ```bash
     git switch develop
     git pull origin develop
     git merge main
     git push origin develop
     ```
