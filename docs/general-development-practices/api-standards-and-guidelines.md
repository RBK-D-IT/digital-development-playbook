# API Standards and Guidelines

This document provides the **standards** and **guidelines** that our team follows when developing APIs. By adhering to these practices, we ensure consistency, scalability, and maintainability in our APIs. These guidelines cover API structure, naming conventions, authentication, error handling, and documentation practices.

---

## 1. API Structure and URL Design

APIs should be designed to provide clear and intuitive access to resources. URLs should represent the structure of the data and the actions that can be performed.

### General Guidelines:

- Use **nouns** to represent resources (e.g., `users`, `orders`).
- Use **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions on resources.
- Use **plural nouns** for collections of resources (e.g., `/users`, `/orders`).
- Use **lowercase letters** and **hyphens** (`-`) to separate words in URLs.
- Avoid deep nesting in URL paths to keep them simple and readable.
- Keep URL paths **short** but **descriptive**.

### URL Structure:

/api/[resource-name]/[resource-id] (for individual resources) /api/[resource-name] (for collections of resources)

#### Examples:

- **Get all users**: `GET /api/users`
- **Get a specific user**: `GET /api/users/{userId}`
- **Create a new user**: `POST /api/users`
- **Update a user**: `PUT /api/users/{userId}`
- **Delete a user**: `DELETE /api/users/{userId}`

### Query Parameters:

Use query parameters to filter, sort, or paginate results.

/api/[resource-name]?sortBy=[field]&page=[number]&limit=[count]

#### Example:

- `GET /api/users?sortBy=name&page=2&limit=50`

---

## 2. HTTP Methods and Actions

APIs should use standard HTTP methods to indicate the action being performed on the resource.

### HTTP Methods:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST**: Create a new resource.
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource.

### Example Mapping of HTTP Methods:

- **GET /api/users**: Retrieve all users.
- **POST /api/users**: Create a new user.
- **PUT /api/users/{userId}**: Update an existing user.
- **DELETE /api/users/{userId}**: Delete a specific user.

---

## 3. Authentication and Security

APIs must be secure and protect sensitive data. Use the appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access.

### Guidelines:

- Use **OAuth 2.0** or **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for API authentication.
- Secure APIs with **HTTPS** to ensure encrypted communication.
- Authenticate users before allowing access to protected resources.
- Ensure **role-based access control** (RBAC) is implemented where necessary.

#### Example Authentication Header:

Authorization: Bearer [token]

### Data Encryption:

- All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, personal information) should be encrypted both at rest and in transit.

---

## 4. Error Handling and Status Codes

APIs should provide meaningful and consistent error messages, using appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the result of an operation.

### Common HTTP Status Codes:

- **200 OK**: Request was successful.
- **201 Created**: Resource was successfully created.
- **204 No Content**: Resource was successfully deleted or updated with no content to return.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or cannot be processed.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required or failed.
- **403 Forbidden**: The authenticated user does not have permission to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition.

### Error Response Format:

All error responses should follow a consistent structure, providing useful information to the client.

#### Example Error Response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid request parameters.",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Email format is invalid."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Guidelines:

- Always return **appropriate status codes** to reflect the result of the API call.
- Provide **detailed error messages** to help the client understand what went wrong, but avoid exposing internal details that could be a security risk.

---

## 5. Rate Limiting and Throttling

To ensure that APIs can handle high traffic loads and protect against abuse, rate limiting should be applied.

### Guidelines:

- Implement rate limiting to control how many requests a user or client can make in a given period (e.g., **100 requests per minute**).
- Return a **429 Too Many Requests** status code if the limit is exceeded.
- Provide headers to communicate rate limits and remaining requests to the client.

#### Example Rate Limit Headers:

X-RateLimit-Limit: 100 X-RateLimit-Remaining: 25 X-RateLimit-Reset: 1588610834

---

## 6. API Documentation

APIs must be properly documented to ensure ease of use for developers and clients.

### Guidelines:

- Use **OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)** to generate interactive API documentation.
- Provide clear descriptions for each endpoint, including the purpose of the endpoint, the required parameters, and the expected response format.
- Include examples of requests and responses to help developers integrate with the API.
- Ensure that documentation is kept up to date with changes in the API.

#### Example Documentation Tools:

- **Swagger UI**: For generating interactive API documentation.
- **Postman**: For providing detailed API collections with examples.

---

## 7. Logging and Monitoring

Proper logging and monitoring of APIs are crucial for tracking performance, diagnosing issues, and ensuring system health.

### Guidelines:

- Log all **API requests and responses** (excluding sensitive information like passwords).
- Monitor **error rates**, **latency**, and **response times** to identify bottlenecks or issues.
- Set up **alerts** for abnormal API behaviors (e.g., increased error rates or response time).

---

## Conclusion

These guidelines aim to create APIs that are **consistent**, **secure**, and **maintainable**. By adhering to these standards, we ensure that our APIs are easy to work with, scalable, and reliable for users and clients. Team members are expected to follow these practices throughout the API development lifecycle.
